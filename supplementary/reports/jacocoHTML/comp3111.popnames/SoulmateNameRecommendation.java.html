	/**
	 * Predict the name of the compatible pair (Soulmate) given the user input.
	 *
	 * &lt;p&gt;
	 * &lt;strong&gt;Algorithm:&lt;/strong&gt;
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * The algorithm predict the name of the soulmate of the user by finding the name that have the closest rank to the user's name rank
	 * with the preferred gender in the calculated soulmate's year of birth.
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * The algorithm first calculate the rank of the user's name in his/her year of birth.
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * Then, calculate the year of birth of the soulmate, if the preference is &quot;younger&quot;, the soulmate's year of birth is (user's year of birth - 1),
	 * else if the perference is &quot;older&quot;, the soulmate's year of birth is (user's year of birth + 1).
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * Finally, the algorithm finds the name in the soulmate's year of birth that have the same rank as the user's name rank,
	 * which the closest possible rank to the user's name rank, and returns that name.
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * If there do not exist that has the same rank as the user's name rank, either due to the user's name is not ranked, or
	 * the user's name rank is too low that there is not a name in the soulmate's year of birth with that rank,
	 * the algorithm returns lowest ranked name in the soulmate's year of birth,
	 * which has the closest possible rank with names that is not ranked.
	 * &lt;/p&gt;
	 *
	 * &lt;p&gt;
	 * &lt;strong&gt;Justification:&lt;/strong&gt;
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * This algorithm predicts the soulmate's name by finding a name in the soulmate's year of birth
	 * with the closest rank to the user's name rank in the user's year of birth.
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * This is because the rank of the name basically represents the popularity of a name in the year (as higher rank name has larger occurrence).
	 * With so many possible names, it is very difficult the name of 2 people to be of the same rank and be equally popular in their year of birth.
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * The closer the ranks of the 2 names are, the lower the possibility is.
	 * Such rarity resembles the concept of serendipity, which we use as the criteria for predicting the name of the soulmate of the user.
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * In addition, the soulmate's year of birth (user's year of birth - 1) or (user's year of birth + 1) because
	 * people in the same generation should have more common knowledge and interest, so age difference of 1 should make 2 people a good pair.
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * The original NK-T5 Algorithm of Universal Compatibility also use the above principle to predicts soulmate's name.
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * However, if the user's name is not ranked, or user's name rank is too low that there is not a name in the soulmate's year of birth with that rank,
	 * the original algorithm use the top ranked name in the soulmate's year of birth as the predicted name.
	 * Thus, the predicted name will not have the closest rank to the user's name,
	 * but instead having the largest difference in rank and popularity.
	 * This do not resembles the concept of serendipity, and the name prediction is not coherent in all cases.
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * Therefore, the modified algorithm return the lowest ranked name in the soulmate's year of birth in such case.
	 * As name that is not ranked is name below the lowest ranked name, the lowest ranked name will have the closest rank
	 * to the not ranked name.
	 * Thus, the modified algorithm will always recommend the name with the closest rank to the user's name rank,
	 * making coherent recommendation in all cases.
	 * &lt;br&gt;
	 * Therefore, modified algorithm gives justifiable and coherent prediction of soulmate name in all cases.
	 * &lt;/p&gt;
	 *
	 * @return the predicted name for the soulmate
